## Hash Tables
Overview
- Implement a hash table with the methods listed under Challenge.

## Challenge
Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:

add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
find: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.


## Approach & Efficiency
An array was the chosen data structure to use for the HashTable and a linked list was the chosen data structure for to use at each index of the Hash Table to handle collisions.
