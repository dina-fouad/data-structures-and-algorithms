## Graphs
A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges. the graph can retrive its nodes in multiple ways, some of them are pre-order depth fisrt and breadth first way

## Challenge
The challenge was to create an adjacent list, which is the most common way to represent graphs and it is a collection of linked lists or array that lists all of the other vertices that are connected.

## Approach
Each node is stored in a different linked list and each linked list is sorted in the adjacency list array. Each node has a value and edges.
